Korean OPT eligible students who are considering the OPT process lack the sufficient resources that are needed to jump start their career in the United States because of strict time constraints, insufficient resources for OPT eligible students, and an overall lack of participation or knowledge for U.S. based Korean corporations in SBUâs administration. KCB will solve all three of these conundrums by having its participants share information about various job markets in the United States in the future as well as facilitating the development of alumni networks which are relationships that are mutually beneficial to the students and SBUâs infrastructure and community. KCB prepares students early for the initial post-completion OPT by offering a myriad of opportunities. KCB will act as a bank in terms of contributing and rewarding career related resources by providing a catalyst for members to prepare for success in their specific field. The programs consist of mock interviews, industry analysis, discussions about current affairs across broad industries, PowerPoint preparation, hosting workshops that feature guests, have panel information sessions based on expert experiences, and inviting U.S based Korean corporation recruiters. As a side albeit salient note is that the students do not assume to know everything that there is to know about the entire OPT process.

We offer lectures on algorithmic problems solving, host speakers to discuss algorithms, and provide training sessions for our ACM ICPC teams. Our interest in starting the competitive programming club stems from our active and successful participation in the ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC). ICPC is the oldest, largest, and most prestigious programming contest in the world. Stony Brook teams have a strong record in the past ICPC Greater New York Regional contests: we won the regional championship twice, beating the very best programmers representing Ivy League Schools (Princeton, Columbia, Yale, and Cornell). Most recently, our team finished 4th among over 60 teams in the 2018 Regional Contest. This was also the headline on the Computer Science department website:https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/about-us/News/Topping-Competition-Stony-Brooks-2018-ACM-team-wins-big-programming-contest The article was also featured in Stony Brook News webpage: https://news.stonybrook.edu/student-spotlight/sbus-2018-acm-team-wins-big-at-programming-contest/ An integral part contributing to our past success is the weekly training sessions we host for the Stony Brook ICPC teams. In these training sessions, we deliver lectures covering topics, such as algorithm design, algorithmic problem solving and programming. We also host weekly ICPC-style contests, during which the students collaborate in teams of three to solve ten algorithmic programming problems in five hours on a single computer. Although originally provided for our ICPC teams, we then realize that such lectures are desirable for a much broader audience. Design and analysis of algorithms is an essential part of computer science. More importantly, nowadays programming-related job interviews focus on the intervieweeâs ability to solve algorithmic problems -- which is exactly what the students develop in attending our training courses and the ICPC-style contests. In other words, such lectures will also benefit all students looking for programming-related jobs. As additional evidence, almost all of our past ICPC team members either attend top graduate schools or secure jobs at the most prestigious tech companies, such as Google or Facebook. Our rich experience in organizing these training sessions and programming contests motivates us to start the competitive programming club so that more Stony Brook students will benefit from its various activities. We welcome both undergraduate and graduate students; we also welcome students from different majors and with different academic backgrounds. Indeed, the three members of our top team last year are from the Computer Science, Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Mathematics department respectively. For new and continued membership, our club will attract a large number of students seeking for software engineering jobs and those who are interested in participating in ICPC contests. In the past, we hosted programming contests for SBU students every year to select the top students as our ICPC team members. We typically had around 100 participants in the contests. This proves that we already have a solid foundation for attracting new club members. In terms of activities, our past ICPC team members and faculty members will deliver lectures on algorithms, programming, and algorithmic problem solving every week. These lectures will cover beginner, intermediate and advanced topics -- students who wish to do better in job interviews will benefit a lot from the beginner and intermediate topics, and the advanced topics are more suitable for students who want to be a part of our ICPC team. We also plan to organize weekly contests for students to sharpen their problem solving and algorithmic skills. The clubâs contribution to the Stony Brook community is two-fold. First, it provides valuable opportunities for all Stony Brook students to learn more about algorithms, programming and computer science in general. In particular, members of the competitive programming club will get the chance to improve their algorithmic problem-solving skill by attending the lectures and attending the weekly contests, which is essential for seeking programming-related jobs. Second, our club will also encourage members with deeper interest to be a part of the Stony Brook ACM ICPC team. Setting up the competitive programming club will enable many more SBU students to be exposed to competitive programming and ICPC, and consequently strengthen our ICPC teams significantly. It will also help the Computer Science Department and SBU to gain local and nation-wide reputation by having our members to secure better jobs and winning prizes in the prestigious ICPC contests.','Department of Computer Science, Stony Brook UniversityStony Brook, NY 11794-2424United StatesContact Email E: sbucompprog@gmail.com','E: sbucompprog@gmail.com','NA','NA','NA'),

The name chosen, Sigma Delta Phi, was soon changed to Sigma Delta Tau when the women discovered the letters belonged to another Greek organization. Most of the seven had experienced the subtle, but very real, discrimination practiced against religious minorities by many Greek organizations at the time.The seven women - Dora Bloom, Amy Apfel, Marian Gerber, Grace Srenco, Inez Ross, Regene Freund, and Lenore Rubinow - in response to the closed doors, and as a way to meet their own social and housing needs, established a sorority which would respect the individuality of its members. Thus the purpose of Sigma Delta Tau became âto form a close social and fraternal union of those of similar ideals and to foster, maintain and instill such ideals in the hearts of its members as will result in actions worthy of the highest precepts of true womanhood, democracy and humanity." (Sigma Delta Tau National By-Laws, Article 1, Section 2).The Beta Phi chapter was formed on April 8th, 1984, when fourteen young women came together to form the first national sorority chapter at Stony Brook University. Their chapter became initiated as the Beta Phi chapter on December 1st, 1984.  The women focused on expanding the chapter with beautiful, intelligent, and sophisticated young women much like themselves. Since then, Beta Phi has continued to flourish as a well-rounded sisterhood. â¨The Beta Phi chapter has fostered the personal growth of its members by offering opportunities in leadership and philanthropy, as well as academics and social interactions. We hold our academic careers in the highest regard and encourage new sisters to always put education first. We also strive to be active members on campus and in our surrounding community. Beta Phi loves to fundraise for our national philanthropy with bake sales and car washes, educate our peers with informative programs, and team up with other sororities and fraternities to work towards the betterment of our school. We regularly support our Seawolves sports teams and compete in Greek Week every year.  Beside our academics and school spirit, sisters in the Beta Phi chapter hold sisterhood as a top priority. We can usually be found together, whether it''s in the library or Starbucks!

The repercussions are huge. An estimated 3.8 million people in the United States live with untreated mental illness in any given year. This includes around 40% of people with untreated bipolar disorder and 51% for untreated schizophrenia. And the consequences of this are, of course, extreme. 79% of people with major depressive disorder stopped themselves from doing something important in their personal lives. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, 13,000 suicides are committed each year by adults in the US with untreated schizophrenic, manic or depressive symptoms.Since Ervin Goffmanâs seminal work on stigma, there has been an increased body of literature pertaining to this topic. Some of these papers even highlight effective stigma reduction techniques, but few nonprofit organizations and mental health awareness groups have incorporated such techniques into their structure.The Humanology Project aims for a reduction in the stigma of mental & neurological illnesses by bridging the gap of knowledge of attitudes. We do so through the translation of peer-reviewed literature into understandable articles and through a storytelling platform where patients can share their stories so readers gain a more holistic sense of the person.  We envision a more inclusive & understanding world where people with stigmatized illnesses receive the quality of care and treatment they need.','humanologyproject@stonybrook.edu','humanologyproject@stonybrook.edu','NA','NA','NA'),
